Get a report on your domains and their registration information. Multiple output types supported: Object, CSV, XML and a color coded, sort able HTML report. Supports domain names from the pipeline, in a file or just by using the -Domain parameter.

This is an update of my old WhoIs.ps1 that broke when the JSON feed I was using updated their API and I wasn't able to get it to work with PowerShell anymore.

To use the report, download it and: 
1. Save as Get-WhoIs.ps1 
2. Then get the help: Get-Help .\Get-WhoIs.ps1 -ShowWindow
